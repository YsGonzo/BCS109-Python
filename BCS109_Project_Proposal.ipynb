        "Cars are an essential form of transportation that have been consistently evolving with different car brands bringing more innovation than the next. This data set can help us understand what makes the best car for a specific userbases (sports car vs gas economic car). Various attributes of a car such as cylinders, body shape, fuel-type, peak rpm, etc vastly influence its performance and for which a large portion of people are most concerned about - gas mileage. Gas prices have increased and more fuel ecomonic choices are becoming much more appealing. We want to find common attributes from vb\n",

We believe that horsepower, number of cylinders, and drive-wheel (4WD, RWD, FWD) will hold the most influence over gas ecomony. Our hope is that this information can be used to either make more efficient vehicles or assist those that are looking for a more specific perfomance out of a car.\n",
